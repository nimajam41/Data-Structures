# Data Structures & Algorithms Assignments

This repository includes my solutions to the assignments of CE40254 (Data Structures & Algorithms) course at Sharif University of Technology, Spring 2019.

## Structure
Source code is partitioned into six folders, each correspond to an assignment. 

### P1
Assignment #1 is mainly about basic Python and sorting algorithms.

### P2
Queue, stack, and merge sort are the main subjects of Assignment #2.

### P3
Assignment #3 is focused on tree structures, including BST and Trie.

### P4
Problems of Assignment #4 are about heap and disjoint sets.

### P5
While three of four problems of Assignment #5 are about hashing algorithms, the other one is a combination of hashing and binary search.

### P6
Graph traversal and shortest-path algorithms are the major topics in Assignment #6.
